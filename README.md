 Two new worlds were created, store.world and curvedMaze.world. However even though the worlds can be uploaded successfuly when using;

```sh
gazebo worldname.world

```

When loading using;

```sh
roslaunch diffbot diffbot_world.launch
```
the meshes does not instantiate and the robot fall into oblivion.
